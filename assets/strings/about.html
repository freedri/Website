<p><b><i>king without a heart ❤️ king without a hope 🤷 oh im a king without a crown 👑</i></b></p>

<p>Hi, I'm Bri Reid, 24 y.o. artist and Computer Science PhD student. I'm bisexual and agender, and my pronouns are <b>they/them</b>. I like art. My favourite song is Domino Dancing by Pet Shop Boys. I live in Australia. My favourite colour is red. I hate binaries and being categorized. I'm a socialist lol.</p>

<p>My second passion is music. I love synth-pop, disco, hi-NRG, new wave, goth and alternative rock. You can check out my playlists in my social media links!</p>

<p>Don't talk to me about work! I study software engineering. I am the spirit of laziness so my research is focused on ways to make programming easier. I use my creativity to come up with ideas, design UIs for prototype apps and make nice charts. Donna Summer's She Works Hard for the Money is praxis.</p>
